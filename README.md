# Frank's Code Test

This is the web application portion of a code test project I was tasked with for a job interview.

## 1. Create Root Directory

Open your terminal and run these commands to create a root directory for the web application and server.

 `cd desktop`
 
 `mkdir CodeTest`
 
 `cd CodeTest`

Now clone the web application into that directory.

  `git clone https://github.com/Rynebenson/FranksCodeTest.git`
  
  `cd FranksCodeTest`
  
  `npm install`

Open another tab in your terminal. Make sure you are back in the root directory before you clone the server.

Now clone the server into the directory.

  `git clone https://github.com/Rynebenson/FranksCodeTestAPI.git`
  
  `cd FranksCodeTestAPI`
  
  `npm install`
