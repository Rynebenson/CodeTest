## 1. Create Root Directory

Open your terminal and run these commands to create a root directory for the web application and server.

 `cd desktop`
 
 `mkdir CodeTest`
 
 `cd CodeTest`

<a name="clone-repositories"></a>
## 2. Clone Repositories and Install Packages

Open two tabs in your terminal under the root directory.

In the first tab run these commands to clone this repository and install it's dependencies.

  `git clone https://github.com/Rynebenson/FranksCodeTest.git`
  
  `cd FranksCodeTest`
  
  `npm install`

Now open the second tab and run these commands to clone the server repository and install it's dependencies.

  `git clone https://github.com/Rynebenson/FranksCodeTestAPI.git`
  
  `cd FranksCodeTestAPI`
  
  `npm install`
