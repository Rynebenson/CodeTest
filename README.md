This is the web application portion for a Code Test I was given for a job interview. To run this project you'll need the server portion as well. Run the following commands in your terminal to view the project locally.

I suggest creating a root directory for both the web app and server.

 `cd desktop`
 
 `mkdir CodeTest`
 
 `cd CodeTest`

Now clone the web application into that directory.

  `git clone https://github.com/Rynebenson/FranksCodeTest.git`
  
  `cd FranksCodeTest`
  
  `npm install`

Open another tab in your terminal. Make sure you are back in your root direction: CodeTest

Now clone the server into the directory.

  `git clone https://github.com/Rynebenson/FranksCodeTestAPI.git`
  
  `cd FranksCodeTestAPI`
  
  `npm install`
